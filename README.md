# Diabetes Prediction

## Introduction
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project! This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health metrics and factors.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess raw data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features that contribute significantly to diabetes prediction.
- **Model Development**: Train machine learning models using supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction Interface**: Provide an interface for users to input their health data and obtain predictions on whether they have diabetes or not.

## Installation
To set up the Diabetes Prediction Project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Avyukth1C/Diabetes-Prediction.git`
2. Unzip the files.
3. Import the .ipynb into Google Colab.
4. Import the prediction and patient datasets into your Google drive.[Change the file paths in the code respectively]
5. Train the machine learning models using the prepared dataset.

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can:
- Input relevant health metrics such as glucose levels, HbA1c_level, BMI, etc., into the prediction .[Edit the values in the Excel sheet to give the values you desire]
- Obtain predictions on the likelihood of developing diabetes based on the provided input.
- Explore feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to the prediction.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various evaluation metrics and fine-tune the model if necessary.
